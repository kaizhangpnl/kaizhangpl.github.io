E3SM, formerly known as Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME), is a global Earth 
system model developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for high-resolution modeling 
on leadership supercomputing facilities. The model is a descendant of the 
Community Earth System Model (CESM). More information about E3SM can be found below:

A scientific description of the E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM) is available 
`here <https://e3sm.org/model/e3sm-model-description/v1-description/>`_. 
This user's guide focuses on the important technical aspects of EAM. The tools used for
analyzing the E3SM data are reviewed briefly. The differences between 
the current model and the previous versions are also discussed.
