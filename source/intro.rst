Introduction
============

E3SM, formerly known as Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME), is a global Earth 
system model developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for high-resolution modeling 
on leadership supercomputing facilities. The model is a descendant of the 
Community Earth System Model (CESM). More information about E3SM can be found below:

- Project strategy: https://e3sm.org/publications/project-documents/

This user's guide focuses on the atmosphere component. A scientific description of 
the E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM) is available here: 
https://e3sm.org/model/e3sm-model-description/v1-description/

E3SM uses CIME (Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth), which contains the support 
scripts (configure, build, run, test), data models, essential utility libraries, a “main” 
and other tools that are needed to build a single-executable coupled Earth System Model. 

CIME documentation is available here:
