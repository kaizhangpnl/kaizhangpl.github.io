Introduction
============

E3SM, formerly known as Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME), is a global Earth system model developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for high-resolution modeling on leadership supercomputing facilities. The model is a descendant of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). 
This user's guide focuses on the atmosphere component EAM.

E3SM uses CIME (Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth), which contains the support scripts (configure, build, run, test), data models, essential utility libraries, a “main” and other tools that are needed to build a single-executable coupled Earth System Model. 

CIME documentation is available here:
